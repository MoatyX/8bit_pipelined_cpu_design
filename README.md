# 8Bit Pipelined CPU Design
exploring designing an 8bit CPU with Pipeline Stages to increase its frequency from 100MHz to 130MHz and Memory Mapped IO to hook peripheries on the CPU like an 7 Segments Display, Buttons, Switches...etc

## Branches
This Repository has 2 main Branches: 
    
    1- non-pipelined
    2- pipelined

each shows the corresponding VHDL CPU Design. 

## Schematic
There are 2 PDFs provided:

* prefix "principal-": The high-level block design
* prefix "synth-": the synthesized design schematics based on the VHDL code
